All sets of macros following are for use of having a simple quick-key spot for all your teleportation needs.

**Basic Hearthkey**
Use shift to use your Dalaran Hearthstone, ctrl for Flight Master's Whistle, alt for Garrison Hearthstone, and otherwise your normal Hearthstone.
```
#showtooltip
/use [mod:shift] Dalaran Hearthstone; [mod:ctrl] Flight Master's Whistle; 
[mod:alt] Garrison Hearthstone; Hearthstone
```

**Shaman's Hearthkey**
This works as the above macro, but instead uses Astral Recall if you click the macro with your right mouse key.
```
/use [mod:shift] Dalaran Hearthstone; [mod:ctrl] Flight Master's Whistle; 
[mod:alt] Garrison Hearthstone; [btn:2] Astral Recall; Hearthstone
```
